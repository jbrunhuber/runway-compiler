# Goals
The basic goal of this project is to improve my knowledge about the compile process and data structures.

# Compiler
The compiler is the frontend of my language. The output is LLVM bytecode which can be translated to executable binary files using the LLVM static compiler *(llc)*.
The motivation of this software is to create a modular, simple and clean architecture.

#### LLVM
LLVM is a modular compiler-backend architecture. If you want to know more about it visit the [LLVM docs](http://llvm.org/docs/).


# Language
Runway is an imperative programming language with lexical variable scopes, a static type system and structured programming support.
