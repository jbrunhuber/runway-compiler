# runway-compiler
A compiler frontend for the runway language.

# Welcome to Runway!

I want to instroduce you the basic concepts of the runway language. The compiler is at a really (really) early state of development so there may come some changes :)

## Goals
Runway is going to be a modern and easy to use programming language with oop design. With a C-like syntax I provide a fimilar environment with lots of improvements. The language should be easy to use so you don't have to do memory management but benefit from cool things like operator overloading.

## Everything out of the box
A build system, dependency management, a unit-testing framework, everything should work out of the box! So no further applications and configurations are needed for using these tools.
