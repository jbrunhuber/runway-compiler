The compiler is in a really (really) early state of development so there may come some changes :)\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\nRunway is going to be a modern and easy to use programming language with oop design. With a C-like syntax I provide a familiar environment with lots of improvements. The language should be easy to use so you don't have to do memory management but benefit from cool things like operator overloading.\r\n\r\n## Everything out of the box\r\nA build system, dependency management, a unit-testing framework, everything should work out of the box! So no further applications and configurations are needed for using these tools. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
